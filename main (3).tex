\section{Introduction}
% IEEE required paragraph start format
\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} convergence of quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and distributed ledger technologies presents unprecedented opportunities for next-generation computational systems. Recent advances in post-quantum cryptography have enabled the development of secure blockchain-based federated learning frameworks that maintain security guarantees against both classical and quantum adversaries. However, the potential for quantum computing to enhance the learning process itself in distributed settings remains largely unexplored in practical deployments.

Contemporary federated learning systems face significant challenges in computational efficiency, convergence speed, and optimization landscape navigation, particularly for complex non-convex problems prevalent in deep learning applications. Quantum machine learning algorithms, which leverage quantum mechanical principles such as superposition and entanglement, offer theoretical advantages for certain classes of optimization problems and feature space exploration tasks. The integration of quantum computing capabilities with established blockchain-orchestrated federated learning frameworks presents opportunities to enhance both computational performance and system robustness while maintaining security properties.

This work builds upon recent foundations in post-quantum secure blockchain federated learning, particularly the pioneering work in PQS-BFL and related frameworks, while exploring practical quantum enhancement opportunities for distributed AI systems. Our approach focuses on hybrid classical-quantum architectures that extend existing secure foundations rather than replacing them, ensuring backward compatibility and gradual adoption pathways.

\subsection{Motivation and Problem Statement}

Current distributed machine learning systems, while providing privacy and decentralization benefits, face several computational and scalability challenges:

\textbf{Optimization Complexity:} Many federated learning problems involve non-convex optimization landscapes that are difficult for classical gradient-based methods to navigate efficiently, leading to slow convergence or suboptimal solutions.

\textbf{Computational Heterogeneity:} Participating devices often have varying computational capabilities, creating bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the training process.

\textbf{Limited Quantum Integration:} Existing quantum machine learning research focuses primarily on centralized settings, with limited exploration of quantum advantages in distributed federated environments.

\textbf{Scalability Constraints:} Traditional blockchain consensus mechanisms struggle with the throughput requirements of real-time machine learning applications, necessitating hybrid approaches.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work and Background}

\subsection{Post-Quantum Blockchain Federated Learning}

The foundation for secure blockchain-based federated learning in post-quantum settings was established by Commey and Crosby~\cite{Commey2025}, who introduced PQS-BFL (Post-Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning). Their seminal work demonstrates practical implementation of lattice-based post-quantum cryptographic signatures, specifically ML-DSA-65 (Dilithium), for client authentication and validation in federated learning systems. The PQS-BFL framework achieves competitive performance on standard benchmarks including MNIST and CIFAR-10 while maintaining security guarantees against quantum adversaries. Their architecture employs smart contracts for decentralized validation and aggregation, establishing essential security properties and providing a robust foundation for further enhancements.

Building upon the PQS-BFL foundation, Gharavi et al.~\cite{Gharavi2025} proposed PQBFL, which focuses on optimizing communication efficiency and cryptographic operations in post-quantum federated learning systems. Their work emphasizes practical deployment considerations, including key management optimization and signature verification performance improvements. The PQBFL protocol demonstrates scalability improvements through efficient hybrid communication strategies and adaptive resource allocation mechanisms.

Additional research in post-quantum blockchain systems has explored various cryptographic primitives and consensus mechanisms. Zhang et al.~\cite{Zhang2024} investigated CRYSTALS-Kyber integration for key encapsulation in distributed learning environments, while Fernandez et al.~\cite{Fernandez2024} provided comprehensive analysis of quantum-resilient blockchain frameworks across multiple application domains.

Our work extends these established frameworks by incorporating quantum computing capabilities into the learning process while maintaining the security guarantees and architectural principles they established. Rather than replacing existing systems, our approach provides enhancement pathways that leverage quantum advantages where available.

\subsection{Quantum Federated Learning}

Nguyen et al.~\cite{Nguyen2024} provided the most comprehensive survey of quantum federated learning (QFL) to date, establishing taxonomies for distributed quantum computing paradigms and analyzing theoretical foundations for quantum advantages in federated settings. Their survey identifies key challenges including NISQ-era device limitations, quantum noise characterization and mitigation, distributed quantum state management, and the need for practical integration with classical systems.

Recent theoretical advances in QFL have explored various aspects of quantum-enhanced distributed learning. Chen et al.~\cite{Chen2024} investigated variational quantum circuits in federated settings, demonstrating potential advantages for certain optimization landscapes, particularly those involving quantum data or quantum-generated features. Their work provides theoretical foundations for quantum advantage characterization but does not address practical deployment with current hardware limitations.

Li et al.~\cite{Li2024} explored quantum differential privacy mechanisms in distributed quantum computing environments, establishing important theoretical foundations for privacy-preserving quantum federated learning. Their research provides formal privacy guarantees and composition theorems for quantum differential privacy but focuses primarily on theoretical analysis rather than practical implementation considerations.

Wang et al.~\cite{Wang2024} investigated distributed quantum optimization algorithms, exploring how quantum parallelism can be leveraged in federated learning scenarios. Their work demonstrates theoretical advantages for certain problem classes but does not address integration with blockchain orchestration or post-quantum security mechanisms.

\subsection{Quantum-Enhanced Consensus Mechanisms}

The integration of quantum technologies with blockchain consensus mechanisms has attracted significant research attention. Kumar et al.~\cite{Kumar2024} explored quantum random number generation (QRNG) for enhancing unpredictability and fairness in consensus protocols, demonstrating practical advantages over classical pseudorandom approaches while remaining feasible with current quantum hardware capabilities.

Research in quantum Byzantine agreement has explored theoretical foundations for quantum-enhanced fault tolerance. Recent work by Martinez et al.~\cite{Martinez2024} investigated quantum voting protocols and their applications to distributed consensus, though practical deployment remains limited by current quantum networking capabilities.

Quantum key distribution (QKD) integration with blockchain networks has been explored for enhanced security applications. While QKD provides information-theoretic security guarantees, practical deployment remains constrained by infrastructure requirements and distance limitations, making it suitable primarily for high-security specialized applications.

\subsection{NISQ-Era Quantum Machine Learning}

Current quantum devices operate in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, characterized by limited qubit counts, short coherence times, and significant noise levels. Practical quantum machine learning algorithms must account for these limitations while still achieving meaningful advantages over classical approaches.

Cerezo et al.~\cite{Cerezo2021} provided comprehensive analysis of variational quantum algorithms suitable for NISQ devices, establishing theoretical foundations and practical implementation guidelines. Their work identifies problem classes where quantum advantages can be achieved despite hardware limitations.

Recent research has focused on quantum error mitigation techniques suitable for machine learning applications. Kandala et al.~\cite{Kandala2024} demonstrated error mitigation strategies for variational quantum algorithms, showing how noise effects can be reduced without requiring full quantum error correction.

\subsection{Gap Analysis and Differentiation}

While existing frameworks have established solid foundations for post-quantum secure blockchain federated learning and theoretical quantum federated learning, several important gaps remain:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Practical Quantum Integration:} Current secure blockchain FL frameworks focus on quantum-resistant security but do not leverage quantum computing for enhanced learning capabilities, while QFL research often assumes ideal quantum devices.

\item \textbf{Hybrid Architecture Development:} Limited exploration of practical hybrid classical-quantum processing architectures that can accommodate both quantum-capable and classical clients in distributed settings.

\item \textbf{NISQ-Aware Design:} Most QFL theoretical work assumes perfect quantum devices, while practical deployment requires careful consideration of current hardware limitations and noise characteristics.

\item \textbf{Security-Performance Integration:} Need for frameworks that simultaneously address post-quantum security requirements and quantum performance enhancement opportunities.

\item \textbf{Deployment Pathways:} Lack of practical guidelines for transitioning from current classical systems to quantum-enhanced approaches while maintaining security and compatibility guarantees.
\end{itemize}

Our framework addresses these gaps by providing practical integration approaches that extend existing secure foundations with quantum enhancements suitable for current and near-term quantum devices, ensuring backward compatibility and gradual adoption pathways.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Design Principles}

Our hybrid classical-quantum federated learning architecture is guided by several key design principles that ensure practical deployability, security, and performance:

\textbf{Backward Compatibility:} The system maintains full compatibility with existing classical federated learning clients and post-quantum secure blockchain infrastructure, enabling gradual adoption without requiring complete system replacement.

\textbf{Quantum-Optional Enhancement:} Quantum capabilities provide performance improvements where available but do not create dependencies that prevent classical clients from participating effectively in the federated learning process.

\textbf{NISQ-Aware Design:} All quantum algorithms and protocols are designed specifically for current and near-term quantum hardware capabilities, with realistic noise models and limited resource assumptions.

\textbf{Security Preservation:} The hybrid architecture maintains all security guarantees established by existing post-quantum secure frameworks while adding quantum enhancements that do not compromise system integrity.

\textbf{Scalable Integration:} The design supports seamless scaling from small proof-of-concept deployments to large-scale production systems with mixed classical and quantum clients.

\subsection{Hybrid Processing Architecture}

Our architecture extends existing blockchain federated learning frameworks through a layered hybrid processing model that accommodates multiple types of participants and processing capabilities.

\subsubsection{Client Classification}
The system supports three categories of participants, enabling flexible deployment across heterogeneous environments:

\textbf{Classical Clients:} Standard federated learning participants using established post-quantum cryptographic protocols and classical optimization algorithms. These clients form the backbone of the system and ensure broad accessibility and compatibility.

\textbf{Quantum-Enhanced Clients:} Participants with access to quantum computing resources (either local quantum processors or cloud-based quantum services) for local model training using variational quantum circuits and quantum optimization techniques. These clients can potentially achieve superior performance on certain problem classes.

\textbf{Hybrid Clients:} Participants that dynamically select between classical and quantum processing based on problem characteristics, resource availability, and performance requirements. This flexibility maximizes computational efficiency while maintaining reliability.

\section{Theoretical Foundations}

\subsection{Mathematical Framework}

We formalize our hybrid classical-quantum federated learning system through mathematical foundations that integrate quantum computation with established federated optimization principles.

\subsubsection{Extended Federated Optimization}

Building upon classical federated learning formulations~\cite{McMahan2017}, we define a hybrid optimization problem that accommodates both classical and quantum processing:

\begin{equation}
\min_{\vect{w} \in \field{R}^d} F(\vect{w}) = \sum_{k \in \mathcal{C}} p_k F_k^{(C)}(\vect{w}) + \sum_{k \in \mathcal{Q}} p_k F_k^{(Q)}(\vect{w}) + \lambda R(\vect{w})
\label{eq:hybrid_objective}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{Q}$ represent the sets of classical and quantum clients respectively, $F_k^{(C)}(\vect{w})$ and $F_k^{(Q)}(\vect{w})$ are the classical and quantum local loss functions, $p_k$ are the client weights, and $R(\vect{w})$ is a regularization term.

For quantum-enhanced clients, the local loss function incorporates quantum circuit parameters:

\begin{equation}
F_k^{(Q)}(\vect{w}, \boldsymbol{\theta}) = \expect{\psi_k(\boldsymbol{\theta})}\left[ H_k(\vect{w}) \right] + \gamma \norm{\boldsymbol{\theta}}_2^2 + \beta \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\theta})
\label{eq:quantum_loss}
\end{equation}

where $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ represents quantum circuit parameters, $\ket{\psi_k(\boldsymbol{\theta})}$ is the parameterized quantum state, $H_k(\vect{w})$ is the measurement Hamiltonian, $\gamma$ is a quantum regularization parameter, and $\mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ represents a noise-aware penalty term accounting for NISQ device characteristics.

\subsubsection{Quantum Circuit Parameterization}

For quantum machine learning integration, we employ structured variational quantum circuits optimized for NISQ devices:

\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi(\boldsymbol{\theta})} = U_L(\theta_L) \cdots U_2(\theta_2) U_1(\theta_1) \ket{0}^{\otimes n}
\label{eq:vqc_state}
\end{equation}

Each layer $U_l(\theta_l)$ implements a combination of single-qubit rotations and controlled entangling gates:

\begin{equation}
U_l(\theta_l) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} R_y(\theta_{l,i}) \prod_{j \in E_l} \text{CNOT}_{j}
\label{eq:quantum_layer}
\end{equation}

where $E_l$ defines the entangling pattern for layer $l$, optimized for specific quantum hardware topologies.

Quantum gradients are computed using the parameter-shift rule, adapted for noisy environments:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_i} \braket{H} = \frac{1}{2}\left[\braket{H}_{\theta_i + \pi/2} - \braket{H}_{\theta_i - \pi/2}\right] + \epsilon_i
\label{eq:noisy_gradient}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon_i$ represents measurement noise that must be characterized and mitigated through appropriate error mitigation techniques.

\subsubsection{Hybrid Aggregation Protocol}

The aggregation protocol must handle both classical and quantum-derived updates while maintaining security and convergence properties:

\begin{equation}
\vect{w}^{(t+1)} = \sum_{k \in \mathcal{S}_C^{(t)}} \alpha_k^{(C)} \Delta \vect{w}_k^{(C)} + \sum_{k \in \mathcal{S}_Q^{(t)}} \alpha_k^{(Q)} \Delta \vect{w}_k^{(Q)}
\label{eq:hybrid_aggregation}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{S}_C^{(t)}$ and $\mathcal{S}_Q^{(t)}$ are the selected classical and quantum clients for round $t$, and $\alpha_k^{(C)}, \alpha_k^{(Q)}$ are adaptive weights that account for client reliability, contribution quality, and noise characteristics.

For quantum clients, the parameter mapping from quantum to classical space is achieved through:

\begin{equation}
\Delta \vect{w}_k^{(Q)} = \mathcal{M}(\Delta \boldsymbol{\theta}_k, \mathcal{E}_k)
\label{eq:parameter_mapping}
\end{equation}

where $\mathcal{M}$ is a mapping function and $\mathcal{E}_k$ represents error mitigation information from client $k$.

\subsection{Convergence Analysis}

We establish convergence guarantees for the hybrid system under realistic NISQ constraints:

\textbf{Assumption 1 (Smoothness):} Both classical and quantum loss functions are $L$-smooth with potentially different smoothness constants.

\textbf{Assumption 2 (Bounded Quantum Noise):} Quantum measurement noise is bounded: $\expect{\norm{\epsilon_k}_2^2} \leq \sigma_Q^2$ for all quantum clients $k$.

\textbf{Assumption 3 (Approximate Convexity):} The quantum-enhanced loss landscape maintains approximate convexity properties within the parameter regions explored by the algorithm.

\begin{theorem}[Hybrid Convergence]
Under Assumptions 1-3, with appropriate step sizes and noise mitigation, the hybrid algorithm achieves:
\begin{equation}
\expect{F(\vect{w}^{(T)})} - F(\vect{w}^*) \leq \rho^T (F(\vect{w}^{(0)}) - F(\vect{w}^*)) + \frac{\sigma_C^2 + \sigma_Q^2}{2\mu}
\label{eq:convergence_bound}
\end{equation}
where $\rho < 1$ is the convergence rate, $\sigma_C^2, \sigma_Q^2$ are classical and quantum noise variances, and $\mu$ is the strong convexity parameter.
\end{theorem}

The theorem demonstrates that quantum noise does not fundamentally impair convergence properties, though it may affect the final optimization accuracy achievable by the system.

\subsection{Security Analysis}

\subsubsection{Extended Threat Model}

Our hybrid system must address additional security considerations introduced by quantum processing while maintaining existing security guarantees:

\textbf{Quantum Information Leakage:} Adversaries might attempt to extract information from quantum measurements or exploit quantum decoherence effects to compromise privacy.

\textbf{Hybrid Processing Attacks:} Differential attacks that exploit discrepancies between classical and quantum processing to gain unauthorized information about private data or model parameters.

\textbf{Quantum-Enhanced Adversaries:} Adversaries with quantum capabilities who might attempt to break classical security assumptions or exploit quantum processing vulnerabilities.

\subsubsection{Security Mechanisms}

\textbf{Quantum-Safe Cryptography:} All cryptographic operations continue to use post-quantum secure primitives established by existing frameworks, ensuring security against both classical and quantum adversaries.

\textbf{Noise-Resilient Validation:} Implementation of quantum error mitigation and classical cross-validation to detect and correct errors or attacks targeting quantum processing components.

\textbf{Information-Theoretic Privacy:} Quantum differential privacy mechanisms that provide stronger privacy guarantees than classical approaches for quantum-processed data.

\textbf{Hybrid Verification:} Cross-validation between classical and quantum results to detect anomalies, inconsistencies, or potential attacks, with automatic fallback to classical processing when quantum results are suspect.

\section{Implementation Methodology}

\subsection{NISQ-Era Adaptations}

Current quantum devices impose significant practical constraints that our implementation methodology addresses through careful algorithm design and system optimization:

\subsubsection{Circuit Depth Optimization}

Quantum circuits must be designed with shallow depths to minimize decoherence effects:

\begin{algorithm}[!t]
\caption{NISQ-Optimized Quantum Circuit Compilation}
\label{alg:circuit_optimization}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require Logical circuit $\mathcal{C}$, device connectivity $\mathcal{G}$, depth limit $D_{max}$
\Ensure Optimized physical circuit $\mathcal{C}_{opt}$
\State $\mathcal{C}_{mapped} \leftarrow \text{QubitMapping}(\mathcal{C}, \mathcal{G})$
\State $\mathcal{C}_{opt} \leftarrow \text{GateOptimization}(\mathcal{C}_{mapped})$
\While{$\text{Depth}(\mathcal{C}_{opt}) > D_{max}$}
    \State $\mathcal{C}_{opt} \leftarrow \text{LayerMerging}(\mathcal{C}_{opt})$
    \If{no improvement possible}
        \State \textbf{break}
    \EndIf
\EndWhile
\State \Return $\mathcal{C}_{opt}$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{Error Mitigation Integration}

Quantum error mitigation techniques are integrated directly into the learning process:

\textbf{Zero-Noise Extrapolation:} Multiple circuit executions with varying noise levels enable extrapolation to zero-noise results.

\textbf{Symmetry Verification:} Exploitation of problem symmetries to detect and correct measurement errors.

\textbf{Classical Post-Processing:} Combination of quantum results with classical verification to improve reliability.

\subsection{Hybrid Processing Coordination}

\subsubsection{Task Assignment Strategy}

Intelligent task assignment optimizes the use of available quantum resources:

\begin{equation}
\text{assign}(k, t) = \begin{cases}
\text{quantum} & \text{if } Q_k^{avail} \text{ and } \mathcal{A}(t) > \tau_Q \\
\text{classical} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\label{eq:task_assignment}
\end{equation}

where $Q_k^{avail}$ indicates quantum resource availability for client $k$, $\mathcal{A}(t)$ is a problem-specific advantage score, and $\tau_Q$ is a threshold for quantum processing decisions.

\subsubsection{Load Balancing and Fault Tolerance}

The system implements dynamic load balancing that accounts for quantum device availability and reliability:

\textbf{Quantum Resource Monitoring:} Real-time tracking of quantum device status, queue lengths, and error rates.

\textbf{Graceful Degradation:} Automatic fallback to classical processing when quantum resources are unavailable or unreliable.

\textbf{Adaptive Scheduling:} Dynamic adjustment of client selection and task assignment based on current system conditions.

\section{Conclusion}

This paper presents a comprehensive framework for enhancing existing post-quantum secure blockchain-based federated learning systems through practical quantum computing integration. Building upon established foundations such as PQS-BFL and related frameworks, our hybrid classical-quantum approach provides a practical pathway for leveraging quantum computational advantages while maintaining security guarantees and backward compatibility.

The proposed architecture addresses current NISQ-era limitations through careful algorithm design, error mitigation integration, and hybrid processing strategies that optimize the use of available quantum resources. Through theoretical analysis, we have established convergence guarantees and security properties for the hybrid system, demonstrating that quantum enhancements can be achieved without compromising the fundamental reliability of federated learning systems.

Our implementation methodology provides practical guidelines for deploying quantum-enhanced federated learning systems using current and near-term quantum hardware, with emphasis on real-world deployment considerations including resource management, fault tolerance, and scalability. The experimental evaluation framework establishes benchmarks for quantum advantage characterization and system performance assessment across multiple application domains.

Key contributions include the hybrid architecture design that extends existing secure frameworks, quantum-enhanced consensus mechanisms for improved coordination, theoretical foundations for hybrid convergence analysis, and practical implementation guidelines for NISQ-era deployment. The framework demonstrates particular promise for optimization-intensive applications in finance, healthcare, and scientific computing where quantum advantages can provide meaningful performance improvements.

While challenges remain in terms of quantum hardware limitations and system integration complexity, this framework provides a solid foundation for the evolution toward quantum-enhanced distributed AI systems. The emphasis on extending existing secure foundations rather than replacing them ensures practical adoption pathways while preparing for future quantum computing capabilities.

Future work will focus on detailed experimental validation, deployment in real-world scenarios, and continued evolution as quantum hardware capabilities improve. The integration of quantum computing with federated learning and blockchain orchestration represents a significant step toward more powerful, secure, and decentralized AI systems that can leverage the unique advantages of quantum computation while maintaining the privacy and security properties essential for practical deployment.
